**Most naked & helpful you can get.**

WordPress theme loosely based on [Starkers](http://starkerstheme.com/) with a lot of comments for fresh students of [media & communication science](http://www.medienkomm.uni-halle.de/) at the [Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg](http://www.uni-halle.de) to learn the basics of HTML, CSS & WordPress.

Work in Progress...

For the sake of simplification this theme has a lot of features removed. Using this on your own site probably isn't a good idea unless you want to teach the very basics of WordPress theme development.
